This uses the Moltin V2 SDK.  You need to install the pod.

Once you have the project locally, run the below in your terminal
```bash
pod install
```

You can update the store to your store.  In the app delegate change the moltinId to your Client ID.

```bash
    static let moltinId = "Client ID"
```
